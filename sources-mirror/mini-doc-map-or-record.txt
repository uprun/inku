var guid = lookup.uuidv4();

(let 
    "guid"
    (function-call-same-as
        (get-field
            "global"
            "lookup"
            "uuidv4"

        )

    )
)


// if there is no type field then it is map
everything is a map
    map can have fields
    fields can have translations maybe
    value of a field is another map
    like in js arrays are also maps but with fields 0, 1, 2, 3, etc..

seems like i forgot that thinking of an issue upfront is same bad idea as premature optimization

what if there will be a destinction between hosted-code and between Lisperanto-code
    so I can generate host-code in JS later?
